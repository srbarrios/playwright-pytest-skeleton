# playwright-pytest-skeleton
This project serves as a skeleton for a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test automation framework using Playwright, Pytest, and `pytest-bdd`. The purpose is to provide a sample project structure for writing end-to-end tests in Python with a focus on clear, human-readable feature files and reusable step definitions.
